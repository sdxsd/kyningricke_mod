# Kyningricke - What if the norman invasion failed? 
This a mod addressing the question, what if the norman invasion failed?
In 1444 the English heartland is split among 4 rycken (realms). 

The Republik of Lonten, its frail independence preserved by the Duchy of Holtland.
The Merkna Rycke (Mercian Realm) holding the midlands. 
The Anglandna Rycke, the last remnants of the legitimate government, reduced to a rump state.
The Nor√æhymbra Rycke, A northern kingdom, the junior partner of the ascendant Scotland. 

In addition, the Grafdom of Wales, and Cornwall have taken advantage of the chaos
and gained their independence. (for now).
In the north the Kyningricke (kingdom) of Scotland is making moves in absence
of a unified Anglic land. 
To the west, Ireland has ratified a treat, designating the Grafdom of Meath as the High King, unifying the island, save for the Scottish controlled north.
